# <Salman Zahir> | Computer Science Student | Software Engineering Enthusiast | App Developer

## About Me
I’m a sophomore Computer Science student with a passion for software engineering, machine learning, and mobile app development. My current focus is on building scalable and impactful projects, especially in Swift and JavaScript. I’m working on applying my knowledge in algorithms, data structures, and front-end development, aiming to create intuitive and engaging apps. I’m excited to share my progress and collaborate on open-source projects as I continue to grow in this field.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, Swift, C, OCaml, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Assembly
- **Frameworks & Tools**: SwiftUI, Xcode, Git
- **Technologies**: Algorithms, Data Structures, Machine Learning Concepts

## Projects
- **ShufMath**: A SwiftUI-based educational app to help users practice multiplication and division. Built with dynamic state management and engaging animations to make math fun! Focused on real-time feedback, UI/UX design, and learning app architecture.

## Experience
I’m currently deepening my understanding of software engineering principles and machine learning. Right now, I’m focused on hands-on learning through projects like **ShufMath**. I’m applying my knowledge of SwiftUI and algorithms while improving my skills in front-end development and clean, modular code design. I am also working toward contributing to open-source projects to collaborate and grow with the community.
